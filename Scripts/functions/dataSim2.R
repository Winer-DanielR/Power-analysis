# NOTE: It has been modified from its original form to work in this context

# This function used to simulate methylation data

# It is a modification of data2Sim from the methylKit librbary since the original function contains a bug.

require(emdbook)

# The function simulates DNA methylation data from multiple samples
#
#' See ??? for  explanation on statistics
#
# Arguments:
# replicates = the number of samples that should be simulated.
# sites = the number of CpG sites per sample
# site number selected comes from previous studies in guppies
# treatment = a vector containing treatment information.
# percentage = the proportion of sites which should be affected by the 
# treatment, this number was also taken from previous studies
# effect = effect size/size of effect of the treatment
# alpha = shape1 parameter for beta distribution (used for 
# substitution probabilites)
# beta = shape2 parameter for beta distribution (used for 
# substitution probabilites)
# theta = dispersion parameter for beta distribution (used for 
# substitution probabilites)
# covariates = a data.frame containing covariates (optional)
# sample.ids = will be generated automatically from \code{treatment} 
# assembly = the assembly description (e.g. "hg18") 
# context = the experimental context of the data, set to "CpG"
# add.info = if set to TRUE, the output will be a list with the first 
#                    element being 
#                    the methylbase object and a vector containing the 
#                    treatment effect sizes 
#                    of all sites as the second element.

# Returns: a methylBase object containing simulated methylation data, 
# or a list containing the methylbase object and the indices of all treated
# sites as the second element.

# Details:
#' While the coverage is modeled with a binomial distribution, the function uses 
#' a Beta distribution to simulate the methylation background across all samples.\cr
#' The parameters \code{alpha}, \code{beta} and \code{theta} determine this beta
#'  distribution and thereby the methylation values.\cr
#' The parameters \code{percentage} and \code{effect} determine the proportion 
#' of sites that are 
#' affected by the treatment and the strength of this influence, respectively.\cr
#' The additional information needed for a valid methylBase.obj is generated as 
#' "dummy values", but can be overwritten as needed.
